# Programming concepts: when to do what \(conditionals\)? and doing things over and over again \(loops\)

What makes computers flexible in what they do, is that they can do different things in different conditions.  
Let's start with an example to find out how this works.

## Is 3 greater than 2 ?!

![question.jpg](attachment:question.jpg)

The question is simple, but how do you ask this question to a computer? Let's do this step by step.

### A comparison

We'll have to compare number 3 versus number 2. We've already seen that R can act as a calculator, so let's see if it works for this as well:


```{r}
3 >= 2
```

The outcome is a *logical* value, as you have seen before. A logical value can only be TRUE or FALSE.

#### :ballot_box_with_check: Does the logic work the other way around?

Test that some comparison that is indeed wrong will give you a FALSE value.


```{r}
# Compare two numbers to get FALSE as the outcome
5 < 2
```

## Logical operators

These kinds of comparisons (including things about 'equals' or 'does not equal') are called *logical operations*. The greater than sign (>) is called an *operator* or a *logical operator* to be specific.  
Here is an overview of comparison operators that are available.

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| < | smaller than |
| <= | smaller or equal |
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater or equal |
| == | equal |
| != | NOT equal |

These operators work on numbers or character strings, other operators work directly on logical values, and allow us to combine comparisons. The combination gives a single TRUE or FALSE.

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ! | **not** (give the opposite of the outcome) |
| \|\| | **or** (either/or is true for a *single* expression) \* |
| \| | **or** (either/or, but for each element in two vectors) |
| && | **and** (both have to be true for a *single* expression) \* |
| & | **and** (both have to be true, but for each element in  two vectors) |
| xor(a, b) | **exclusive or** either a or b can be TRUE, but not both TRUE or FALSE |

\* Usually, operators work on whole vectors at the same time, as you have seen with multiplication etc. The same is true for | and &, that compare two vectors with logical values.  
:warning: The || and && operators are specifically made to make R do something different based on the outcome of a logical operation. This will become clear below. :warning:

These work a bit similar to mathematical formulas, where you can use parentheses to group comparisons together.

Examples:

```
TRUE && FALSE
-> FALSE

TRUE || FALSE
-> TRUE

!TRUE
-> FALSE

!(3<2)
-> TRUE

(1 < 2) && (3 < 4)
-> TRUE
```

#### :ballot_box_with_check: Try it out yourself

Try to find out the answers to the following questions using these powerful operations.
Some things can't be done at once, for instance simultaneous comparisons. Try to combine the operators to get the answer.

a = 5, b = 4, c = 2

- a > b
- b < c
- a > b > c
- b * c > a


```{r}
a <- 5
b <- 4
c <- 2
```

```{r}
# answer cell
a > b
```

```{r}
# answer cell
b < c
```

```{r}
# answer cell
a > b && b > c
```

```{r}
# answer cell
```

### Vector operators for logic values

Just to make the point from above a bit more clear, let's have a look a vector operator, & \(so single ampersand\).

```{r}
logical_a <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
logical_b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

logical_a & logical_b
```

There also exists the 'double ampersand' operator &&. The output of this operator is _one_ value, TRUE or FALSE. It will therefore only work with two _single_ input values.

If you compare the variables from above, it will give an error:  


```{r}
logical_a && logical_b
```

The following will work:  


```{r}
logical_c <- TRUE
logical_d <- FALSE

logical_c && logical_d
```

Why do we need this? It's because of conditionals, we run some code IF something is TRUE. It won't be possible to do this on a vector. We'll go into that next.

So remember: & is for comparing whole vectors, && is for single values. The same is true for | and ||.   


### Conditionals: do different things based on the outcome

You can run different commands \(functions\) based on the outcome \(TRUE or FALSE\) of some logical operation. The next cell shows how this is done in R:  

Test it for yourself with different values for a and b. Try to predict what happens if a and b are equal!


```{r}
a <- 5
b <- 12

if (a > b) {
    cat (a, "is greater than", b)
} else {
    cat (a, "is smaller or equal than", b)
}
```

### Repetition

You can also use conditions repeat some code, until the condition is TRUE.

```{r}
counter <- 10

# I use "\n" here, which tells R to put the cursor on the beginning of the next line before showing something on the screen.

while ( counter != 0 ) {
    cat ("The counter is at", counter, "\n")
    counter <- counter - 1
}
```

#### :ballot_box_with_check: Use a random condition to run some time

Perform a loop until a randomly drawn value between 0 and 1 is over 0.8.  
To get a random number we use the runif function (random number from uniform distribution) value. Use the help function to read how runif works.

![die.png](attachment:die.png)

```{r}
# Look up help for the runif function
?runif
```

```{r}
# Loop until a random number is > 0.8. Print some text to show we're still repeating the code.

while(runif(1) < 0.8) {
    cat ("Still here - ")
}
```

```{r}
runif(1, min=.5, max=1.5)
```

```{r}
random_number <- runif(n=1)

cat ("first number: ", random_number, "\n\n")

while(random_number < 0.8) {
    cat("In the loop\n")
    random_number = runif(n=1)
    cat("new number", random_number, "\n\n")
}
```

```{r}
repeat {
    cat("abc, ")

    if (runif(1) < 0.2) {
        break
    }
}
```

## Loops

![1088948.jpeg](attachment:1088948.jpeg)

Similar to the `while` statement above, there is a simplified way of repeating some piece of code. For this we use `for`, as follows:

```{r}
1:10
```

```{r}
for ( counter_new in 1:10) {
    cat ("The counter is", counter_new, "\n")
}
```

# Congrats :tada:

You have learnt about very important programming concepts! One more very important thing is about organizing your code using functions and libraries. That's up next.
